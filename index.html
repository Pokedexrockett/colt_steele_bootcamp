    <h1>Asta</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
        Asta 「アスタ Asuta」[3] is an orphan raised under the care of a church in Hage[4] after his mother abandons him on the church's doorstep.[5][6] After turning 15 years old, Asta receives a five-leaf clover grimoire with an Anti Magic devil inside.[7] He joins the Clover Kingdom's Black Bull squad of the Magic Knights[8] and becomes a 1st Class Senior Magic Knight[9] and temporarily a Royal Knight.[10]

    <h2>Appearance</h2>

    <p>
        Asta is a young man of short stature with an exceptionally muscular build. He has green eyes and messy, ash blond hair with bangs in front of his forehead and a single strand protruding upwards from the center of his head. He keeps his hair together with a black headband, which has the gold-colored Black Bull insignia and has a red-colored four-pointed star with three stitches on the back of it. He has numerous scars all over his body from his strenuous physical training[11] and a large scar on his abdomen where one of Mars's Harpes pierced him.[12][13]

        Asta's common outfit consists of a plain-white tunic with a V-shaped collar underneath a dark blue jacket whose sleeves extend only up to his elbows. He sports a pair of matching shorts which         has a stitch marks on the left side. His pants also extends just below his knees. His shoes are made out of two different cloths, the parts covering his ankles, the soles the same color as his        jacket and pants. The parts covering his toes are white, a vertical stitch mark going from the bridge to his toes.

        After receiving his grimoire, Asta wears a pouch strapped to a brown leather belt. Additionally, as a member of Black Bull, he wears his squad's signature robe, which is black and short with      gold trimming and covers the upper half of his torso. It also has a hood and a gold-colored button located at the right-hand side to hold it together, while the left-hand side displays the        squad's insignia.

        After six months of training in the Heart Kingdom, Asta has become more muscular. Additionally, he wears a black, tight-fitting shirt that covers his shoulders, upper arms, and some of his        chest. It is open in the middle and has a gold clover on the right side. Over this, he wears a modified version of his squad's signature robe draped over his left shoulder and attached by a   red cord that wraps around his neck. His headband has three red-colored, four-pointed stars on the front right side and the Black Bull insignia on the left. He also wears a pair of black,      high-waisted pants that are tucked into knee-high boots and a large, brown, double-pronged belt, from which hangs his grimoire pouch.[14]

        After making a bargain with Liebe, Asta's right arm is permanently corrupted. His arm is black with blood red cragged markings, while his fingers are blood red with black cragged markings and         black fingernails.[15][16] After forging an equal contract with Liebe, a dark-colored marking appears around his left wrist. The marking is two thin, spiked lines with demonic lettering       between the lines.[17]

        In his Black Asta form, his right arm is covered in black Anti Magic, a black wing sprouts from his right shoulder, a black horn sprouts from the right side of his head, his upper right canine        tooth elongates, and his right eye turns red with the pupil becoming slit-like.[18] As he draws on more Anti Magic, more of his body is covered, additional horns form on his head, his lower   right canine tooth elongates,[19] his right hand and foot transform into claws, a smaller wing sprouts from his left shoulder, and a tail grows from his back.[20]

    <h2>Personality</h2>

    <p>
        Asta generally is cheerful and hyperactive.[21] He tends to shout to express his thoughts and goals, much to the annoyance of some of those around him, and often in spite of other people's opinions. One of the first examples of this is when he conveyed his goal of becoming a Wizard King during the Magic Knights entrance exam, and told other people who jeered at him to be quiet.[22] Asta's simple yet outgoing personality is frequently played to comedic effect during more serious situations. However, his strong tenacity interests Yami Sukehiro enough to recruit him into his ranks,[23] and his determination also leads him to possess an indomitable will. Asta's determination to never give up, added with his own steel fortitude during grueling or harsh battles, is a trait that becomes the basis for others to acknowledge him, such as Magna Swing.[24] However, Asta has shown to have struggled accepting his lack of magic, using his boisterous attitude as a front to hide his insecurity. After having his arms broken and cursed by Vetto, Asta nearly slips into a depression before talking and forcing himself to continue pushing onward.

        Because of his upbringing in the Forsaken region, Asta frequently receives cruel opinions and insults from almost everyone he meets. To counteract this, Asta appears to have developed a       slightly sarcastic nature as he tries to defend himself.[25][26] The regularity at which he's exposed to such degrading remarks is such that he now has a certain immunity to them, shown when      he easily brushes them off without getting overly annoyed.[27] However, Asta can still become irritated when others deeply insult his comrades; he will not hesitate to confront them as he       tries to defend his friends.[28]


        Asta accepts Noelle as his comrade.

        Asta also has a very strong sense of justice, which is shown during his fight against Heath Grice, as he believes that everyone deserves to be protected.[29] It is also not limited to only his        comrades but his enemies as well, as noted when he asks his fellow squadmates to take the unconscious Mars along with them while the dungeon is collapsing. He argues that their mission is only    to explore a dungeon as they are not ordered to kill any enemies.[30] Therefore, Asta seems to see the positive side of everyone and never takes an insult too seriously, as seen when he still      befriends both Yuno and Noelle Silva even after both had openly looked down on him.[31][32] Even when Fana is trying to kill him and his allies with all her power, he attempts to reason with     her as a means to understand and talk her down from her rage, showing consideration for nonviolent methods of solving conflict. He later continues to do this with the reincarnated elves,       despite no success among repeated attempts.

        However, Asta also believes that those that have done wrong should work to actively make up for their wrongdoings. He always holds his enemies accountable for their misdeeds, regardless if he         has forgiven them or not. He requests that Neige spend time in prison before promising to become his friend. He later demands that the weakened Ladros apologize to and help all the people he      has harmed. In another example, he puts Rades into a submission hold during their next meeting, nearly breaking his arm until the latter successfully convinces him that he will use his powers     to help the people in the capital rather than for revenge.

        His open, friendly, and non-judgmental attitude, indomitable will, and stubbornness has earned him the respect of almost everyone he meets, even nobles such as Klaus and Fuegoleon Vermillion.         It has also earned him the affection of numerous girls, though his love for Sister Lily, combined with his somewhat dense personality, has made him largely oblivious of this fact. This love       for Lily and obliviousness also make him somewhat chivalrous and non-perverted, as he absolutely refused to try to peek on the girls while bathing at the hot spring.

        While an immensely endearing and honest person, who can win over people with his tenacity, Asta can come off as quite stupid to those around him. Asta is not exactly stupid but growing up in      an orphanage in the middle of nowhere has left him ignorant of many things that others consider common knowledge and his headstrong nature makes him come across as the stereotypical muscle        head with little to no brains. His naivete constantly leads him to blurt out things with little to no tact or care for the situation at hand, and his blind trust of people in the kingdom     despite evidence to the contrary has made him very easy to fool, depending on the situation. His trusting, truthful nature has been taken advantage of by the courts and he nearly spoke his       guilt without thinking of the consequences while he was on trial. He is also very ignorant about many things in the kingdom and on its functions which Magic Knights should know with most of     his squadmates is that he does not know many simple things such as how corrupt the system ruled by the nobles really is which almost cost him and Marie their lives.
